## CHANGELOG
   0.1.1 - Extended with additional field extractions
   0.1.0 - Initial Release

## INSTALLATION

   Install this Splunk technology add-on on your indexers, heavy forwarders, and search heads. The add-on provides configurations for search-time field extractions.

### Prerequisites

   + Splunk(R) Enterprise v7.x
   + Arbor Edge Defense or Arbor APS v6.2 or later

### Installation Summary

   1. Configure Splunk Enterprise to accept network monitoring input as described in the [Splunk documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.6/Data/Monitornetworkports).

      Splunk recommends using a [Splunk forwarder](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Forwarder/7.3.0/Forwarder/HowtoforwarddatatoSplunkEnterprise) to avoid possible disruptions (Splunk restarts) with the syslog stream. The NETSCOUT AED/APS add-on relies on sourcetype being set to `netscout:aed`. 

      You can set up the network input in the Splunk UI or by using an [inputs.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.2.6/Admin/Inputsconf) file. For example:

      ```
      [udp://514]
      connection_host = ip
      index = main
      sourcetype = netscout:aed
      no_appending_timestamp = true
      ```

   2. Configure AED to send syslog notifications to Splunk. In AED/APS, select **Administration > Notifications > Notifications Destinations tab**, and then add a syslog destination with the following settings:

      Host: The Splunk hostname or Splunk forwarder  
      Protocol: UDP  
      Syslog Format: CEF or LEEF. The Legacy format is not supported.  
      Alert Type: Blocked Host
